# swordx2
A lightweight terminal application that reads from one or a bunch of text files and prints the number of word occurrences to an output.\
Original "swordx" was made as an academic assignment, and was shitty planned, poorly made and most importantly rushed.\
This is his rebirth: "swordx2"!\
It's almost completely rewritten, the data structure used to store words was changed from linked list (slow and absolutely inefficient) to binary search tree (less complex and much faster), some options were added and some big mistakes were taken care of.\
It still remains an academic project, made in spare time and just for fun, as a sort of challenge to myself, so IT IS still not perfect, but here it is.
